Data Analysis project -1
EDA on Retail Sales Data

Description:

In this project, I have worked with a dataset containing information about retail sales. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help the retail business make informed decisions.

Key Concepts and Challenges:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the retail sales dataset.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).
Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques.
Customer and Product Analysis: Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
Visualization: Present insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps.
Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations based on the EDA.

1. Dataset Overview:
- The dataset contains 1,000 transactions with 9 columns including transaction details, customer demographics, and sales information
- Data covers transactions from January 2023 to January 2024
- No missing values or duplicate rows were found

Based on the provided retail sales EDA analysis, here are the key insights in concise paragraphs:

1. Gender Distribution and Sales
Female customers represent a slight majority (51% vs 49%) of the customer base and generate higher overall sales. This suggests untapped potential in targeted marketing campaigns for the female demographic.

2. Age Demographics
The 46-55 age group dominates customer distribution with 229 purchases, followed by 26-35 (205) and 36-45 (202) age groups. Middle-aged and older consumers show particularly strong purchasing patterns, indicating they should be a key focus for marketing efforts.

3. Product Category Performance
Clothing leads in quantity sold (894 units), followed by Electronics (849) and Beauty products (771). However, Electronics generate the highest revenue despite lower unit sales, suggesting higher profit margins in this category. This points to a healthy mix of high-volume and high-value products in the retail portfolio.

4. Seasonal Trends
Peak sales activity occurred during May-June 2023, indicating strong seasonal patterns. This timing could be linked to holiday shopping, seasonal promotions, or other cyclical factors. Understanding these patterns is crucial for inventory management and promotional planning.

5. Price and Quantity Metrics
The average purchase value is $456.00, with prices ranging from $25 to $500 per unit. Most transactions involve 1-4 items, with a mean quantity of 2.5 items per transaction. This information is valuable for pricing strategies and inventory management decisions.

These insights suggest opportunities for targeted marketing, seasonal promotions, and product category optimization to maximize sales performance.
